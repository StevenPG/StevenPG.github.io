	<h4> To Do list</h4>
	<hr>
	<ul>
	  <p> - Reminder to implement a night-mode (turn all white to dark gray color)</p>
	  <ul>
            <p> - Idea A: Use innerHTML to change a CSS property and remove those properties from file (unsure if will overwrite) </p>
            <p> - Idea B: Use Javascript or JQuery to have a sliding bar that when clicked, will do the same as above, just more elegantly </p>
            <p> - Idea C: Figure out another way to change property involving whatever else is neccesary </p>
          </ul>
	  <p> - Link and work on linear algebra on khanacademy</p> 
	  <p> - Link to all active projects, have a project page with repository listings</p>
	  <p> - Figure out how to redirect and update using script, idea below</p>
	  <ul>
	    <p> - Idea A: stevenpg.github.io has a simple redirect script, use python script on rpi to find current external ip address.
	      Once IP is found, create a new text file based off the old text file but with ip replaced inside the html in the text file.
	      Then have script to update github repository with new script. Publish process on github as a way to avoid ISPs changing IP.</p>
	  </ul>
	  <p> - Try to get a test page for Web java working, listed as github repository and updated as such, but posted primarily on here<p>
	  <p> - Hook up external, and figure out how to make it password encrypted. Or not, probably not neccesary...</p>
	</ul>
	<p> - Figure out what to do with the follow me on github box, since github should link to this website (link by IP)</p>
	<ul>
	  <p> - Repositories should be stored in project pages here. So github is only neccesary for codebase and direct github access
	    might be best to just note it as such</p>
	</ul>
	<p> - Get address and post link to Ruben's blog</p>
	<p> - Scan and post all Linear algebra notes and document in page for later access, try to be neat in the beginning when working on it</p>
